# Data Structures II

_Algoma University   |   Dec 2021_

Continuation of the study of data structures and the analysis of algorithms, trees, binary search trees, balanced trees, B-trees. In this course we shift our focus from linear data structures to non-linear data structures (trees, graphs). We also investigate the special challenges presented when the need to store and retrieve large amounts data requires the use of mass storage devices (such as hard disks) instead of random access memory. We specifically examine the properties of B-tree structures. These are used to provide efficient indexing of data in contemporary commercial database systems. Recursive programming techniques, elimination of recursion. Applications.
